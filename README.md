# Web Scraping Project: Reviews Scraping from Flipkart.com

Hello everyone,

I'm excited to share that I have successfully deployed my first project on AWS (Amazon Web Services), and I couldn't be more thrilled about it! üöÄ

## Overview

For this project, I developed a powerful web scraping application that extracts valuable reviews from Flipkart.com, one of India's leading e-commerce platforms. The objective was to collect and analyze customer feedback, helping businesses make data-driven decisions and enabling consumers to make informed purchasing choices.

## Technologies Used

The project leveraged cutting-edge technologies to ensure efficiency, scalability, and a smooth user experience:

- **Flask**: The web application's backend was developed using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. Flask provided a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the web scraping process.

- **Python**: As the driving force behind the application, Python facilitated the implementation of web scraping algorithms and data processing.

- **Beautiful Soup**: This Python library played a pivotal role in parsing HTML and XML documents, allowing the extraction of relevant review information from Flipkart's web pages.

- **MongoDB Atlas**: To ensure efficient data storage and retrieval, I integrated MongoDB Atlas as the database for this project. Its NoSQL architecture allowed seamless handling of unstructured review data.

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: For hosting the web application, I utilized AWS services. Specifically, I used Elastic Beanstalk, a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering, to manage application deployment, scaling, and automatic load balancing.

- **CodePipeline**: To streamline the deployment process and maintain continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), I established a seamless pipeline between GitHub and AWS using CodePipeline. This enabled automatic deployment of updates whenever new code changes were pushed to the GitHub repository.

## Web Scraping Process

The web scraping application utilizes the power of Python and Beautiful Soup to crawl through Flipkart.com and extract valuable reviews for various products. Here's a high-level overview of the scraping process:

1. **Product URLs Collection**: The application starts by collecting URLs of product pages from Flipkart's search results based on user-defined search criteria (e.g., product category, keyword).

2. **Scraping Reviews**: For each product URL, the application visits the page and extracts the customer reviews, including the reviewer's name, rating, review text, and other relevant details.

3. **Data Cleaning**: The extracted data may contain noise and irrelevant information. To ensure high-quality data, the application performs data cleaning and filtering to retain only valid reviews.

4. **Data Storage**: The clean review data is then stored in the MongoDB Atlas database for further analysis and retrieval.
